<p>I selected a surfing theme.  I selected this theme since I surfed all the time growing up in Hawaii.  Unfortunately, I only get to the beach a few times a year now.</p>
<p>In this lab (Lab3) I have first decided to refactor my code from Lab2, and put all the surfing content into an object, then in main body of the program, calls are made to items in the object.</p>
<p>Don't forget to replace all of the capitalized elements in this template with your information.  Your term number should be in a <em>yymm</em> format, including the year and the month.</p>
