<p>I selected a surfing theme.  I selected this theme since I surfed all the time growing up in Hawaii.  
Unfortunately, I only get to the beach a few times a year now.</p>

<p>In this lab (Lab3) I have first decided to refactor my code from Lab2, and put all the surfing content 
into an object, then in main body of the program, calls are made to items in the object.</p>

<p>In addition to the above I added the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have added more math in the Array Function Task area.  I have added math to calculate the percentage 
of waves that have passed.</li>

<li>In the Array Function Task area, I added nested while loops and nested conditional statements so the surfers 
who catch a wave are taken off (shift) from the front of the array and put (push) on the end of the array (just so 
I could test the array methods).  If there are more surfers then waves in a wave SET (a SET is X number of 
continuous waves before a noticable break with no waves.), then during the next SET you will see the next surfer 
in line catching the wave.  AGAIN, I did this to test array methods.  NOT sure I would do this in real life. In real
life, I may opt to just move the index number.
</li>
</ol>
