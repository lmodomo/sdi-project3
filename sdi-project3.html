<p>I selected a surfing theme.  I selected this theme since I surfed all the time growing up in Hawaii.  
Unfortunately, I only get to the beach a few times a year now.</p>

<p>In this lab (Lab3) I have decided to FIRST refactor my code from Lab2, and put all the surfing elements 
into an object, then in main body of the program, calls are made to elements in the object.</p>

<p>In addition to the above I added the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have changed the story slightly in Lab3.  In this lab I am adding in a surfing competition angle.  So I feed
the application a JSON file of data.  The data in this file represent those surfers who have signed up early for
the competition.  This file only contains ID, name and age. For the lab purpose it does not contain all the real
life data items.  Once I extract the data from the JSON file, I add one competitor (Josh Donlan), and show this 
in the console.log. 
</li><br>
<li>
I then take the data from the Object above, and created an array of surfer names only (for the early registers).
</li><br>
<li>
Added a Method Mutator to push three new competitors into the array of surfers.  This represents surfers,
who are signing up during the day of the surf meet.
</li><br>
<li>In the Array Function Task area, I added nested while loops and nested conditional statements, so the surfers 
who catch a wave are taken off (.shift) from the front of the array and put (.push) on the end of the array (just so 
I could test the array methods).  If there are more surfers then waves in a wave SET (a SET is X number of 
continuous waves before a noticeable break with no waves.), then during the next SET you will see the next surfer 
in line catching the wave.  AGAIN, I did this to test array methods.  NOT sure I would do this in real life. In real
life, I may opt to just move the index number.
</li><br>
<li>Added more math in the Array Function Task area.  I have added math to calculate the percentage of waves that 
have passed.
</li><br><li>
Added a Method Accessor that gets the next surfer in line to catch the first wave in the next set of waves.
</li><br>

</ol>
