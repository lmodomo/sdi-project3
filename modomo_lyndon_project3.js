/* Comment:  
In this lab I have first decided to refactor my code from Lab2, and put all the surfing content into an object, 
then in main body of the program, calls are made to items in the object.

In addition to the above I added the following:
	1.  I have added more math in the Array Function Task area.  I have added math to calculate the percentage 
		of waves that have passed.

	2. 	In the Array Function Task area, I added nested while loops and nested conditional statements so the surfers 
		who catch a wave are taken off (shift) from the front of the array and put (push) on the end of the array 
		(just so I could test the array methods).  If there are more surfers then waves in a wave SET (a SET is X 
		number of continuous waves before a noticable break with no waves.), then during the next SET you will see 
		the next surfer in line catching the wave.  AGAIN, I did this to test array methods.  NOT sure I would do 
		this in real life. In real life, I may opt to just move the index number.
